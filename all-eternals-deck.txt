Brave young cowboys 32 
Of the near northside 33 
Mount those bridge rails 
Ride all night 
Scream when captured 
Arch your back 
Let this whole town hear your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans Am 34 
High beams in rain 
Drive wild broncos 
Down the plain 
Push up to the corner 
Where the turbines hiss 
Someday we won't remember this

Crawl 'til dawn 
On my hands and knees 
God damn these vampires 35 
For what they've done to me

Tie those horses 
To the post outside 
And let those glass doors 
Open wide 
And in their surface 
See two young, savage things 
Barely worth remembering

Feast like pagans 
Never get enough 
Sleep like dead men 
Wake up like dead men 
And when the sun comes 
Try not to hate the light 
Someday we'll try to walk upright

Crawl 'til dawn 
On my hands and knees 
God damn these bite marks 
Deep in my arteries

Crawl 'til dawn 
On my hands and knees 
God damn these vampires 
For what they've done to me


Let the camera pull back 
'Til the fullness of the frame is clear and plain 
Peer into the screen until you see it all 
Like a vision in a crystal ball 
Let it all fill with smoke 
Is this somebody's idea of a joke

Let the fixer work 38 until the silver's washed away 
And take the picture from the tray 
Look hard at what you see and then remember you and me 
And let the truth spring free 
Like a jack-in-the-box 
Like a hundred thousand cuckoo clocks 
From the Oregon corners 
To the Iowa corn 
To the rooms with the heat lamps 
Where the snakes get born

Crawl through the tunnel and follow 
Follow the light northwest 
See that young man 
Who dwells inside his body like an uninvited guest 
See the tunnel twist 
Clutch your birthright in your fist

Let the camera 
Do its dirty work down there in the dark 
Sink low, rise high 
Bring back some blurry pictures to remember all your darker moments by 
Permanent bruises on our knees 
Never forget what it felt like to live in rooms like these 
From the California coastline 
To the Iowa corn 
To the rooms with the heat lamps 
Where the snakes get born


Crude little wooden idols 
And aviator shades 
The trinkets and the treasures 
We brought back from the crusades

Some guy in an Impala 41 
Shakes his head when he rides by 
But I remember when 
We shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar 
We made it earn its keep 
The cracks across its surface 
Spiderweb while we're asleep

The sacrificial stains 
All spreading out and soaking through 
But I remember when 
We kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water 
The eagle spots the fish 
Every martyr in this jungle 
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots, stupid stock shots 
From the Pomona mall 42 
Set up like unloved icons 
Gathering dust up on the wall

From films no one remembers 
They call down silently 
But I remember when their names 
Were dear to you and me 
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar 
Everything's gotta go 
The things that we can't even give away 
I don't wanna know

Try to see if secrets burn 
When you hold them up into the light 43 
I remember when 
We loved each other day and night

And high above the water 
The eagle spots the fish 
Every martyr in this jungle 
Is gonna get his wish


Halls of the stone tower in the foothills 
Why should we hide from anyone 
Held you in my arms for the first time that day 
Felt like God's anointed when you didn't push me away

Gold light shining on so many things 46 
In the age of kings 
Gold light shining on so many things 
In the age of kings

Lean on the concrete walls in shadow 
Why should we wait to throw the switch 
Felt your name burning like a tattoo into my skin 
Rain on the clay tiles all night, your head nestled beneath my chin

Gold light shining on so many things 
In the age of kings 
Gold light shining on so many things 
In the age of kings

In the lost age 
Where the jewels hide 
And the sword sticks 
In the waiting stone 47 
Still warm

Small chambers shrinking 'til they vanish 
Wolves in the hallway gaining ground 
Reach down to the moment when I should have said something true 
Shadows and their sources now stealing away with you

Gold light shining on so many things 
In the age of kings 
Gold light shining on so many things 
In the age of kings


One clear shot or else he gets away 
Red sun high in the sky tonight 
Look west from London 51 down toward Hollywood 
Remember the first days in California

You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on 48 52 
You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on

Fat rich men love their twelve year olds 53 
Deco cuff links 54 and cognac by the glass 
Look west from London toward the Emerald City 55 
Remember Minnesota 56

You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on 
You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on, or their gloves

Sweet spearmint and bitter tangerine 
Bedside decked with roses 
Look west, look west, look west and look away 
From old familiar faces

You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on 
You don't want to see these guys 
Without their masks on


Come hard through the fog 
Blindfolded and bound 
'Til we stand at the edge 
Of a hole in the ground

We hold hands and we jump 
And as we fall we sing 
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle 
Going to meet the king

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep 
Never sleep, remember to breathe 
Breathe deep

Crash in from deep space 
Shot birds falling fast 
Who will be there to catch us in his jaws 
When we arrive alive at last

I can't hear you in the dark 
Wish I knew where you'd gone 
Know you're there, off in the shadows somewhere 
Trying to soldier on

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep 
Never sleep, remember to breathe 
Breathe deep and breathe humbly 
Secure your mouthpiece when you can 59

Toxic shapes adorn the walls 
As we rise from our knees 
Someone's coming to reward us, you wait and see 
Or crush us both like fleas

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep 
Never sleep, remember to breathe 
Breathe deep


"One, two, three, and."

I heard the wings beat on the wind tonight 
As the heat stole power from the darkening light 
I saw the streets fill up with people that I knew 
People who looked like you

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake 
We are young supernovas and 
The heat's about to break

Drift through the streets, walk between the cars 
Newborn sons and daughters spat forth from distant stars 
The summer will reveal itself to those whose hearts are true 63 
And to the faithless few

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake 
We are young supernovas and 
The heat's about to break

Who will rise and who will sink 
Who's going to stand his ground 
And who's going to blink

Surge forward from Van Cortlandt Park 64 like frightened sheep 
Spirit throngs that hoist us high, three thousand warriors deep 
Spray our dreams on any surface where the paint will stick 
Try to time the rhythm, listen for the click 65

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake 
We are young supernovas and 
The heat's about to break


Gather jewels from graveyards 
When I get home bury them again 
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance 70 
To ask me why I turned you in 
I saved my own skin but I live to fight 
I live to fight another day 
Still remember how brave you were 
When they came to take you away

And I feel guilty 
But I can't feel ashamed 
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Thought I'd seen the ghost up on the boulevard 
Between the broken bits 
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit 
From clever counterfeits 71 
Sleepwalk through my days and mark 
The hours until these dark times fade 
Like a caterpillar 
Crawling out along the surface of the blade 72

And I feel guilty 
But I can't feel ashamed 
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutted storehouse now 
And lick the sweat from my brow

Saw the trucks roll out this morning 
Not sure when they're coming back again 
Feel the prickings of my conscience 
In my chest every now and then 
Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness 
Rises up and blesses me 
And other times the sickness howls 
And I despair of any remedy

And I feel guilty 
But I can't feel ashamed 
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain


Bang the small rocks on the big ones 
Til the small ones are sharp and clean 
Catch something, kill something 
New blade cuts real keen 76

And then the grass grows up to cover up 
The firepit and the forge 
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge 77

Chew these roots for a toothache 
Chew these ones for atmosphere 
Dream the pleasant dreams that people dream 
When they grow up down here

And then the grass grows up to cover up 
The firepit and the forge 
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Take care of the old man 
See if he's in pain 
Have somebody stay with him 
Comfort him when he complains

Keep to ourselves mostly 
Few friends and fewer closer friends 
Lead a long life if you're lucky 
Hope it never ends

And then the grass grows up to cover up 78 
The firepit and the forge 
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge 
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge


If you really want 
To conjure up a ghost 
Cultivate a space 
For the things that hurt you most

Rake the sands until they surface 
Blind their tiny eyes

Stake out your position 
Let your armor fall 
Stay put til they find you 
It won't take long at all

Rake the sands until they surface 
Up they come, gone translucent 
They're coming up no matter what 
Fools rush in 80 and the doors slam shut

Ghosts of my childhood 
Stay with me if you will 
Find a place where there's water 
Hold you under til you're still

Rake the sands until they surface 
Don't let anybody call them ugly


"This song is called For Charles Bronson. One, two, three, and."

Catch a lucky break 
Try to make it last 
Rig a blanket curtain up between 
The present and the past

Play my lucky numbers 
For most of what they're worth 
Lie about my age 84 right down 
To my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune 
Concentrate 
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight 85

Hit the gym each night 
Stay cool and seldom speak 
Keep the heart of a champion 
Never let them see you're weak

And whatever they say 
On your page three mention 
Focus on the parts that make you feel good 
Be grateful for the attention

Set your sights on good fortune 
Concentrate 
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight 
And true 
And steady 
Let the frame find you 
When the cameraman's ready

Work until I drop 
Drift from place to place 
Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania 86 Scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune 
Concentrate 
Pull back the hammer 
Try to hold the gun straight 
Try to hold the gun straight


It's so good to learn 
That right outside your window 
There's only friendly fields 
And open roads 
And you'll sleep better when you think 
You've stepped back from the brink 
And found some peace inside yourself 
Lay down your heavy load

It gets alright 
To dream at night 
Believe in solid skies 
And slate blue earth below 
But when you see him, you'll know

It's OK to find 
The faith to saunter forward 
With no fear of shadows 
Spreading where you stand 
And you'll breathe easier just knowing 
That the worst is all behind you 
And the waves that tossed the raft all night 
Have set you on dry land

It gets OK 
To praise the day 
Believe in sheltering skies 
And stable earth beneath 
But hear his breath come 
Through his teeth 89

Walk by faith 90 
Tell no one what you've seen

It's so good to learn 
That from right here the view goes on forever 
And you'll never want for comfort 
And you'll never be alone 
See the sunset turning red 
Let all be quiet in your head 
And look about 
All the stars are coming out

They shine like steel swords 91 
Wish me well where I go 
But when you see me, you'll know

There's the part you've braced yourself against and then 
There's the other part 
Steal up inclining northward streets 
With some weird sickness in the dark 95

Saw your name on the sidewalk 96 
Saw your brave face in my mind 97 
If you're gonna sit next to the dealer 
You get to bet blind 98 99

Never get away, never get away 
I am never ever gonna get away
From this place
Lay down on the street 
My eyes toward the sun 
Your star next to my face 96

The compasses I came into this world with 
Never really worked so good 
Gentle shadows spilling down the hills 100 
Up on Mulholland at Ledgewood 101

Turn back, turn back 
Find someone to tell your secrets to 
Dream past an old hotel on Ivar 102 
And seconds later I saw you

Never get away, never get away 
I am never ever gonna get away 
From this place 
Lay down on the street 
My eyes toward the sun 
Your star next to my face

Let the camera track me 
From the footlights to the wings 
Let me set aside an hour or two 
In memory of sweet things

Regrind the lens again and again and again and again 
But still the picture flips 
Anyone here mentions Hotel California 103 dies 
Before the first line clears his lips

Never get away, never get away 
I am never ever gonna get away 
From this place 
Lay down on the streets 
My eyes toward the sun 
Your star next to my face


On the crooked road that took me north 
And brought me home again 107 
From the pit of writhing serpents 
Out to the lion's den 
Where the labyrinth is lightless 
And the faithless wander crazed 
Let the light rise from the darkness 
Let his name be praised 108

From the sunrise of my childhood 109 
To its premature demise 
From my mother's best intentions 
To my stepdad's seething eyes 
From the hidden self-inflicted wounds 
That flowered in later days 
To the folly of their learning 
Let his name be praised

In the holes the worms have eaten 
Through all once-treasured things 
From the wet mouth of the vulture 
To the red tips of his wings 
In the dazed eyes of the penitent 
Emerging from the maze 
In his wordless explanations 
Let his name be praised


Tunnel down to the core 
Climb through the trapdoor 
Soft pink sky full of rumpled clouds 
Radio up loud

There's a pop in the speakers 
Where I hear your voice come through 
So brave and true 
When did I lose sight of you

Come and rattle your chain 
All you want 
You're always gonna be welcome 
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt

Ride the sentimental rodeo 
Down to where the shadows grow 
Long while since I felt this way 
Stand by the window, wait for day

There's a pop in the speaker 
Where I hear your voice come through 
So brave and true 
Let me never lose sight of you

Come and rattle your chain 
All you want 
You're always gonna be welcome 
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt
