I was having visions of sugared pastry 
Cooked up in clarified butter 20 
I tried to turn my visions into prayers 
But I built my castle way up high in the air

Yeah, I came to the gates of the fabled pink city 18 
Hungry and tired and cold 
Swing low, sweet chariot 21 
Chrome tailpipes shining, bright as spun gold

My brothers picked me up out of the rushes 22 
Handed me into to the company of evil men 23 
But I inched my way down the Eastern Seaboard 
I am coming to Atlanta again 24

Yeah, I came to the gates of the fabled pink city 
Hungry and tired and mad as all hell 
Swing low, sweet jewel-encrusted chariot 
Make me young again, make me well

I am the killer, dressed in pilgrim's clothing 25 
I'm the hard to find stations on the AM band 26 
I am the white sky high over Tripoli 27 
I am the land mine hidden in the sand

Yeah, I came to the gates of the fabled pink city 
Hungry and tired and alone 
Swing low, sweet, sweet, sweet chariot 
Coming for to carry me home 21

Streak the windows 
Smear the walls with coconut oil, 31 yeah 
Fill the cast-iron kettle with water and magnolia blossom 32 33 
Let it boil 
Let the water roll 
Let the fire take its toll

I'm coming home 
I'm coming home

Dust off the idols, give them something to eat 
I think they're hungry, I know I'm starving half to death 
I know you're waiting, I know you've been waiting for a long, long time

And I'm coming home 
I'm coming home

Set the table those three extra places 
One for me, one for your doubts, and one for God 
Let the incense burn in every room 
Feel the fullness of time 34 in the empty tomb 35 
Feel the future kicking in your womb 36

I'm coming home 
I'm coming home

Seventeen years ago 39 
They told me to teach him everything I know 40 
Let the fire rain down 41 
Rain down 
Watched it flare up inside his heart 
Saw it tearing him completely apart 
Head to toe 
I know

And blood will run through the streets of Rome 42 today 43 
And roll across the ocean

Fourteen years ago tonight 
Watched him tearing through the garden killing everything in sight 44 
I let my curiosity 
Get the best of me

I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside 
No one around him to stem the rising tide 
Evil from his head down to his feet 
Quinines bitter, sugars sweet

And blood will run through the streets of Rome today 
And roll across the ocean

I will sail 
To the far shore 
And I will chop 
A hole in the hull too big to repair

And I will turn 
The soil with my hands 
And I will make 
My home there

My garden will grow so high 
My garden will grow so high 
That I will be completely hidden

And I will go 
Where I will go 
And I will jettison 
All dead weight

And I will use 
These words for kindling 
And I will sleep 
By the garden gate

My garden will grow so high 
My garden will grow so high 
That I will be completely hidden

When Death came calling today 
I heard the gentle grace of his cadences 
I couldn't say no 
I couldn't say no

When he showed me his new silk scarves 
Laid out on the shiny black plastic tray 
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no 
I couldn't say no

And I'm sorry I couldn't 
You know how badly I wanted to 
Didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want to lose you

But his smile was dazzling 
And his eyes were sparkling 
Like moonlight 
On the water at midnight 
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no 
I couldn't say no

The sun came up above the strange white plain 
Blood-red flowers all wet with rain 
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore 
But the flesh was very, very strong 47

And I've got very little money left and I've got no sense 
But I'll have none of your goddamned impudence 
Sun came up above the new white fields 
Everything was new again

Pure power stripped of meaning 
Sky burning 
Spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin 
Pretty little yellow eyes that flutter in the wind 
I'd be grateful my children aren't here to see this if you'd ever seen fit to give me children

And my defenses may be working with a skeleton crew 
But I'll be skinned alive before I'll take this from you 
The sun came up above the ocean out west 
All the colors of the rainbow

Stand up straight you can see the house leaning 
Day breaking 
Spring cleaning

On the way home from the party 
Neither of us said a word 
LeAnn Rimes 49 on the car stereo 
Sang that song you know I hate, the one about the blackbird 50 
And the rain came down on the windshield 
I wished it would wash us both away 
You had to open up your mouth, didn't you 
I knew what you were gonna say 
And you were Bluebeard's wife 51 
Opening every cupboard trying to find the smoking gun 
I told you, I told you 
I told you not to open that one

The way that everybody's voice 
Comes out muffled when they speak 
The way we take our diminishing inventories 
Month to month and week to week

The Maria Callas 54 records 
On the stereo all the time 
You're gonna get yours 
And I'm gonna get mine

'Cause in this car, in this car 
Somebody's bound to get burned 
I know, I know 
'Cause I've been watching the road turn

The Enigma Variations 55 
On the radio 
The things that I could guess at 
The things that I already know

When the twelve thousand dollars 
That turned up in your purse 
You've done something awful 
I've done something worse

And in this car, in this car 
Somebody's bound to get burned 
I know, I know 
'Cause I've been watching the road turn

As we cruised across 
The Canadian border 
You reached into your handbag 
Pulled out a microcassette recorder 
Started quoting Tolstoy into the machine 56 
I had no idea what you meant 
Guess I'm supposed to figure these things out 
Or maybe it's supposed to be self-evident 
But I've gone feral 
And I don't speak the language anymore 
We're headed deep into the forest 
I got the pedal to the floor 
The engine shudders like a dying man 
When you reach out to grab my hand 
You could bring out all your weapons 
You can't make me go to war

Long winding Canadian highways 
Innumerable evergreens 
Weather forecast on the AM radio 
Says, "We'll be expecting highs in the low teens" 
When I mouth my silent curses at you 
I can see my breath 
I hope the stars don't even come out tonight 
I hope we both freeze to death 
Look at the person I've turned into, tell me how you like him now 
No standards of any kind to break, no creeds to disavow 
I am right here where you want me 
Do what you brought me out here for 
You can arm me to the teeth 
You can't make me go to war

The last white slabs of snow 
Melted off seven weeks ago 
And the geese are headed north again 
Through the tightening sky, and I 
Can feel my heart in my throat again 
New onions growing in the ground

The cows come gingerly out of the barn 
When they see that the ground is warm 
They pick up a little speed, it makes me feel so good 
And I feel it rushing down my throat, fresh blood 
I head out onto the earth, its cold heart is melting 
I don't know if I can stand it 
Springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around 
New onions growing underground, underground

Bluejays and Cardinals all come out to play 58 
The highway traffic gets out of your way

Skies clear up if they're overcast 
Pit bulls are gentle when you come past

Stars come out of hiding for you 
And I would too, but this world couldn't hold you 
You slipped free 
Without me

The new sheen over everything 
When you open up your mouth to sing

Baseballs travel faster when you watch them fly 
Apples fatten on the trees when you walk by

You bring something unreplaceable to each and every day 
Or you used to anyway, but this world couldn't hold you 
And you slipped free 
Yeah, this world couldn't hold you 
You slipped free 
Without me

If you get there before me 
Will you save me a seat? 
If you get there before me 
Would you save me a seat? 
And if I never get there at all 
Would you leave the seat empty?

If you get there before me 
Will you light us a fire? 
If you get there before me 
Will you light us a fire? 
And if I never show 
You can watch the embers glow 
You can keep the fire burning

This is a song for you in case I never make it through to where you are 
This is a song for you in case I never make it through to where you are 60

The rain fell all night 
And it kept me awake 
It was still falling by morning 
It was hard to take, and you were 
Sleeping on the floor 
Breathing free and even 
If I ever want to drive myself insane 
All I have to do is watch you breathing 
And at 5 AM 
I turned the radio on 
And an old man's voice 
Sang a short, sweet song 
And then the static roared again 
Hungry for blood 
I heard the rain falling from the rainspout 
Down, down into the sweet, wet mud 
And you punched out all the windows 
And the wind began to wail 
And you gathered your hair behind your head 
Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail 
And then the old voice crackled through the static 
And I felt young and alive 
And the hairs stood up on the back of my neck 
We were rising from the grave 
Yeah, yeah

Bag full of oily rags 
Fifty cent lighter 
Dreams of retirement in Canc√∫n 64 
Burning ever brighter 
There's a lot of ways to make money in this world 
But I can't recommend insurance fraud

Burnt out shell of a Volkswagen 
Blood stains on the driveway 
Torn up Mercedes 
By the side of the highway 
Big plans, big plans 
Let me tell you something, sister 
You will never get away with it

I was sitting in the recliner with the TV on 
When you said something evil, and then you were gone 
Explosives in the water main 
A blown fuse 
College graduation photograph 
Splashed all over the 6 o'clock news 
I won't be cashing in your policy 
'Til I find out what it is you're trying to do to me 65

I could almost hear the rhythm section 
Kick in as the sun began to blaze 
I saw you walk across the plaza 
Figured I'd just play it like it lays 69 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I think I'm gonna be real sick again 
Think it's gonna happen real soon 
And I know I can't afford another night here in this place 
With its sixteenth floor view of the ocean and the dunes

And it's gonna be just you and me today 
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay 70

I can hear the roar of the crowd 
In the stadium a couple blocks away 
It's the kind of thing that used to get me all worked up 
But I don't want to talk about it now, OK, OK? 
OK

I just want to get this whole thing over with 
I don't want to deal with it anymore 
I hear the cogs all slipping at the same time 
And then I see you walk in through the door

And it's gonna be just you and me today 
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay

Clear sky over Calcutta 2 71 
Warm wind 
Dvo≈ô√°k 72 on the shortwave 
Clear signal coming in

La la la 
La la la la la 
La la 
La la la la la la la

Long vowels spill like liquid from your mouth 
I hang on every word you say 
An army of transistor radios on the bookshelf 
Left on all day 
Let them play 
Yeah, let 'em all play on and on and on 
Let 'em all play longer and louder 
Long after you're gone

La la 
La la la la la 
La la 
La la la la la

Clear sky sheltering our fragile little house 
Listening to the radio all the time 
Your hand on my forehead as though to check for a fever, yeah 
Big plans in mind

La la la la 
La la la la la 
La la la la 
La la la la la la la 
La la 
La la la la la la 
Yeah, yeah
