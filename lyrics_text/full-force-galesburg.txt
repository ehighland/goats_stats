You've had it up to here with my West Country 16 talk 
You can hardly understand a word I say 
Shortest tree around here is a hundred feet tall 
It's gonna rain today

I try and tell you secrets 'til my face turns blue 
I am not getting through to you 
All away across the ocean they're gathering their strength again 
Lining up along the country's length again

This morning I know who you are 
This morning I know who you are

On the river, the sun is bright gold 
And the things you try to say to me make my blood run cold 
But I hold you anyway 
And we stare into the sun all day

And you're about to leave again, I've learned to read your movements 
And I'm learning how to read your mind 
The sun climbs the sky for us above the Mississippi 17 
And I feel you in my arms but you're hardly even with me

This morning I know who you are 
This morning I know who you are

You came down from heaven to the branch outside my window 
Your feathers were the color of snow 
The dice were loaded against us ever seeing each other 
But one of us had nowhere else to go

In your eyes were all the colors that the rainbow forgot 
Your wingspan was three feet wide or better 
With your voice practicing notes from time's own beginning 
You took apart the alphabet letter by letter

And here 
Where it all stops for good 
Where the cool waters run 
Thought I saw a mouse kicking in your beak 
It was only a skeleton

Sure as a surgeon 
You slipped your hand into the doorjam 
Blood coursing through the air tonight 
I know who I am

And I know who you are 
Or who you were just an hour ago 
Static interference on the radio tonight 
I know what I know

Quick as lightning 
You brought your hand back inside 
And you shut the door behind you 
It's too hot out there tonight

Breath rising and falling 
Expansion, contraction 
Why'd you tell me this 
Were you looking for my reaction

Most of the brine has got to boil away 
Most of the air has got to choke it 
Most of June I spent in jail again 
I don't mean jail exactly

Up in the pine tree 
Red squirrel looking down at me

I am losing control of the language again 
I am losing control of the language again

Most of the things I used to hold on to 
Most of the things I used to say to you 
Most of the ways I knew around the local roads 
Are disappearing daily

High in the cottonwood 
You were looking down at me and you sure looked good 
Hair hanging down in the leaves 
Neck tilted back to make a rainbow

I was losing control of the language again 
I was losing control of the language again

Wax paper that I taped over the windows 
Melted quick as chocolate in the heat 
It'll probably never come off now 
The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street

And the dim light that filters through 
Cast a new light on you 
It makes me get all misty because I remember something 
And then I see your shadow

And I 
I want to follow you all the way down this time 
I want to see what it is you're going down for 
I, I want you more than I want anything 
I want you the way you were

You were lying in the moonlight 
Outside in the grass 
When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark 
And I saw a wing shadow pass

And just then the gleam in your eye 
Made my blood freeze 
There was something up above us 
Rustling in the branches of the trees

And I 
I pressed up against you again 
I could hear your heartbeat steady and hard and pure 
I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me 
And I want you the way you were

I know what my weaknesses are 
Probably better than you do 
Revolutionary Chinese propaganda 
The color of blue

I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway 
And then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday 24 
There was nothing in it but pain for me

I know what can hurt me real bad 
And what can't hurt me anymore 
I know how to rise up with the sun 
And I am learning what sleep's good for

I thought I'd figured out the world and its circular way 
And then I saw the sun fall down out of the sky the other day 
There was nothing in it but pain for me

Squirrels climbing trees in bloom 
Soft yellow light spilling into the room 
My favorite records 
My favorite books 
The people I love 
The people I almost love

Light beckoning 
Wind whistling 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Day breaking 
River rolling 25 
Hey, hey 
La la la la la

On Venus it rains sulfuric acid 27 
But the raindrops evaporate before they hit the ground 
Japanese red-crowned crane 28 by the water here 29 
Trouble in town

I feel like I'm gonna drown down here 
It's all coming down, down here

Hurricanes in from Australia 
Tore up the neighborhood 
A telegram from Lithuania 30 
And the news is not good

And I don't speak the language down here 
It's all coming down, down here 
Yeah

Johnson Johnson is my name 
Brooklyn is my station 
Heaven is my resting place 
God is my salvation 31

You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy 
As we drove across the river into western Illinois 17 
And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel 
Wheels were spinning out sparks, scraping at the rails 
Wind in your hair all right 
Sunset spilling through the rear window 
Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders, beaded with sweat

On the day that I become so forgetful 
That all of this melts away 
I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down to 
Such a worthless day

As we walked across the parking lot toward the motel office 
We were walking with a benediction on us 
Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky 
Like a monument to desperation two floors high 
Mile and a half from the river 
We went back to the car to get our overnight bags 
Sunset spilling through your earrings all over your body

When we shut the motel room door behind us 
We knew we'd hit the mother lode 
On the day that I forget you 
I hope my heart explodes

The land's opening up like a blanket 
And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out 
Along the fields which are evidently endless

And we are hotly in love with one another 
We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats 
We are for some reason all the time bleeding 
And we are friendless

And we love these dogs 
That roll on the lawns here in Galesburg 3 
Because they seem to know something nobody else knows 
It is written in the smiles on their faces 
And it rings in their high, young voices 
We are burning up all of our choices up here where the tall grass grows 36 
Up here in Galesburg

The sky's opening up like an old wound 
And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight 
And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder

We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again 
There is no chance of getting enough of it 
And we tally up all up all our possessions 
We're going under

Yeah, we love these dogs 
That lull in the rain here in Galesburg 
As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms 
Yeah, they howl as though the world were ending 
As we are watching the sky unwinding 
And some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form 
Up here in Galesburg 
Up here in Galesburg

Way up north 
Down the road a little 
Back in New England 
Right here in the middle

And all the way out west 
We had our ears to the ground 
All of our dreams resting in the same spot 
Listening for the old sound

And it was ringing as clear as crystal 
And it was shining as bright as gold 
Grain gathering on the stone floor 
And we were spring-heeled and we were real cold

All summer long 
Deep into autumn 
In a high room 
And down here in the bottom 
Down here in the bottom

Sun twinkling on the river this eve 
I tasted chocolate on my tongue 
Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky 
Rung by agonizing rung

I heard firecrackers popping next door 
Wondered what it was I'd bargained for 
When I laid quiet on the floor 
And you were knocking

Let me be your witness 
Let me walk out on the edge 
Sun refused to shine on my backyard today 39 
Darkness climbing up the house coming through the window ledge

I saw the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk 
Heard you talking your baby talk 
Saw the bright lights again and I felt the shock 
When you were knocking

Lying in the hot sun today 
Watching the clouds run away 
Thought a little while about you 
The sky was a petrifying blue

And while the geese flew past for no reason at all 
I let the sky fall 
This is an empty country and I am the king 
And I should not be allowed to touch anything

I picked myself up off the ground 
Shook the grass from my hair and I walked around 
Felt the warm sun in my eye 
Strangers were passing by

I shinnied 41 up the black walnut tree 42 
Let the hard blue sky fall right through me 
And I saw the sad young cardinals trying to sing 
And I should not be allowed to touch anything

When you were nineteen I first laid eyes on you 
The small stream that ran through the center of town carried your name to me 
Your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue 
And then they put me in jail 'til you were 23

When you were 24 we took to drinking and dancing 
We boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos 
And then we went down to Chechnya 44 for the weekend 
Your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true

And things are happening here while we sleep 
I can feel it in my boiling brain 
And I'm dreaming in blood-red color 
When I see the Stolypin car 45 riding through the light rain

They'll have to carry me out on my back 
They'll have to tear me to pieces all right 
We are warm in our hidden room down here 
We've got stars in our eyes tonight

Seeds came in the mail today from Holland 48 
And the language on the package is wonderful and strange 
All sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth 
In goodly colors gloriously arranged 49 
I circled the house and I scattered them around 
Let the water sink down into the soil 
Stared a long time at the residue 
Blood, milk, and oil 
God, the humidity is something 
Our shirts are soaked clean through 
But the house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming 
And I keep looking at you

And then you're singing in Dutch to me 
And I recognize the song 
And it seems so old and so fragile 
And I haven't heard it in so long 
We may throw the windows open later 
But we are not as far west as you suppose we are 
Hot wind coming off the water 
Sky gone crazy with stars 50 
While we stay here, we imagine we're alive 
We see shadows on the walls 
There's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air 51 
Sweat, water, and alcohol 
Just the old blood 
Rising up through the wooden floor again 
Just the old love 
Asking for more again

Rain all burned away 
The horseflies are an iridescent green 
Plums boiled down to pulp 
Drying on a screen

Bright red air inside the house here 
I can barely draw breath 
Dark blue shapes pop behind my eyelids 
I am not afraid of death

And on the television 
Black and white footage of the young Cassius Clay 53 
My God, my God, my God 
He was something

Fists flashing as he comes toward the screen 
Sailing headlong into nothing 
And disappearing 
Reappearing 
Out there in the clearing 
Floating down a slight breeze 
That plays along the edges of the leaves 
It's you 
It's you 
It's you

Meanwhile out where nothing starts 
Out where the railyard ends 
The sun up above us is trying to kill himself 
We were watching the skies again

Why do we come down to Brownsville 
Year after year after year 
This was the question we never even posed 
Ringing like a siren in our ears

Down on the Mexican border 
In the unfathomable heat 
With our shirts tied around our waists 
And the world at our feet

We looked at one another's bodies 
Figured we looked all right 
Ready to die if we had to 
Watching the skies all night

And I was sure my heart would break 
When the sun sank down into California 
I felt your breath on my neck, it was hot and good and pure 
And I wanted to warn you

It's all coming apart again 
It's all coming apart again 
It's all coming apart again 
It's all coming apart again
