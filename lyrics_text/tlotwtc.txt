I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick 
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers 
I sold 
Self-help tapes 
Go down to the netherworld 
Plant grapes 8

And as word spread of my powers, they would seek me far and wide 
All sad faces at my window, I would welcome them inside 
I sewed clothes for them 
Cloaks and capes 
Go down to the netherworld 
Plant grapes

My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go 
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow 
There's more like me where I come from 
So mark our shapes 9 
Go down to the netherworld 
Plant grapes

Pulled off the highway in Missouri and lo, our hearts were heavy-laden 13 
Made for the chapel with some spraypaint for all the things we'd held in secret 
Lord, lift up these lifeless bones 
Light cascading through the windows, all the rainbow's heavy tones 
He has fixed his sign in the sky 14 
He has raised me from the pit and set me high 15

Left that place in ruin 
Drunk on the spirit and high on fumes 
Checked into a Red Roof 16 then stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants 
In the burning fuselage of my days 
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise 17 
He has fixed his sign in the sky 
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new 
Each day shot through 
With all the sharp small shards of shrapnel 
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas, we will get there when we get there, don't you worry 
Feel bad about the things we do along the way but not really that bad 
We inhaled the frozen air 
Lord, send me a mechanic if I am not beyond repair 
He has fixed his sign in the sky 
He has raised me from the pit and he will set me high

House up in Clear Lake 21 
Where I used to live 
Picked the lock on the front door 
And felt it give

Touch nothing, move nothing, stand still 
Keep my ears open for cars 
See how the people here live now 
Hope that they're better at it than I was

I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here

Pictures up on the mantle 
Nobody I know 
I stand by the tiny furnace 
Where the long shadows grow

Living room to bedroom to kitchen 
Familiar and warm 
Hours we spent starving within these walls 
Sounds of a distant storm

I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here

Fight through the ghosts in the hallway 
Duck and weave 
Stand by the door with my eyes closed 
When it's time to leave

Steal home before sunset 
Cover up my tracks 
Drive home with old dreams that play in my mind 
And the wind at my back

Break the lock on my own garden gate 
When I get home after dark 
Sit looking up at the stars outside 
Like teeth in the mouth of a shark

I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here 
I used to live here


The path to the awful room 
That no one will sleep in again 
Was lit for one man only 
Gone where none can follow him

Try to look down 
The way he'd gone 
Back of the closet whose depths go on 
And on and on

Nice people said he was with God now 
Safe in his arms 
But the voices of the angels that he heard on his last days with us 
Smoke alarms

Well, the path to the palace of wisdom 25 
That the mystics walk 
Is lined with neuroleptics 26 
And electric shocks

Hope daily for healing 
Try not to go insane 
Dance in a circle with bells on 
Try to make it rain

And nice people said he had gone home to God now 
Safe in his arms, safe in his arms 
But the voices of the angels singing to him in his last hours with us 
Smoke alarms, smoke alarms


Masks hanging on the tomb walls 
Where the coven grieves 
Witches hiding in the brambles 
Ground level down by the dry leaves

Blow and burn slowly 
No ground is ever gonna hold me 30

White candles in the manor 
Where the curse takes hold 
Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl 
Make your own friends when the world's gone cold

It gets dark and then 
I feel certain I am going to rise again 
If not by faith then by the sword 
I'm going to be restored

Build the fires to keep the beacon flashing 
Where the earth lies flat 
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down 
Invent my own family if it comes to that

Hold them close, hold them near 
Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here 
Steal the treasure and try to leave town 
Fight my way back down

Don't want to hurt anyone 
Probably gonna have to before it's all done 
Take to the hills, run away 
I'm going to get my perfect body back someday 
If not by faith then by the sword 
I'm going to be restored


For several days the visitors were here 
We saw them turn down and we watched them disappear 
Talked about the days they'd said were sure to come 
Had a hard time believing

I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb 
When you first came here from wherever it was you came from 
The power in your voice, your rough touch 
You keeping care of me, keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent 
Wonder where the good times went 
I will do what you ask me to do 
Because of how I feel about you

I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light 
Try to imagine anything so bright 
You only see it once and it steals until the dawn 
And then it's gone forever

For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind 
Harder days coming, maybe, I don't mind 
Sounds kind of dumb when I say it but it's true 
I would do anything for you

Open up the promise of the day 
Drive the dark things away 
I will do what you ask me to do 
Because of how I feel about you


Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow I can't live like this 
And in the shower I am a sailor standing waiting ready for the ship to list 36 37 
Everything looks burned up I'm too scared to look around 
Don't feel like going on but come on make a joyful sound

If you will believe in your heart 
And confess with your lips 
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself but everything ends in a cul-de-sac 
The beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back 
Don't see what the point is in even trying to fight 
Look for the bigger picture when I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart 
And confess with your lips 
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel 38 
Consider the clues 
Wait as long as I have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to keep the day from staring back at me 
Busy hours for joyful hearts and maybe later head out to the pharmacy 
Won't take the medication but it's good to have around 
A kind and loving God won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart 
And confess with your lips 
Surely you will be saved one day

In the holding tank I built for myself 
It's feeding time 
And I start to feel afraid 'cause I'm the last one left in line 
The endless string of summer storms that led me to today 
Began one afternoon with you long ago and far away

And someone leads the beast in on its chain 
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain 
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

In the cell that holds my body back 
The door swings wide 
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside 
And if the clouds are gathering it's just to point the way 
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day

And someone leads the beast in on its chain 
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain 
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

They'd hooked you up 
To a fentanyl drip 45 
To mitigate the pain a little bit 
I flew in 
From Pennsylvania 
When I heard the hour was coming fast 
And I docked in Santa Barbara 
Tried to brace myself 
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes 
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate 
And my brakes are gonna give and I won't know till it's too late 
Tires screaming when I lose control 
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll

Find the Harbor Freeway 46 
And head south 
Real tired 
Head kind of light 
I found Telegraph Road 47 
I'd only seen the name on envelopes 
Found the parking lot 
And turned right

I felt all the details 
Carving out space in my head 
Tropicanas on the walkway 
Neon red 
Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay 
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away

And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing 
Try to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything 
People screaming when the engines quit 
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside 
And as it turns out, I'm not ready 
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze 
You said hello to me 
We all stood there around you 
Happy to hear you speak 
The last of something bright burning, still burning 
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy

And you were a presence full of light upon this earth 
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth 
It's three days later when I get the call 
And there's nobody around to break my fall 48


The sun above me and the concrete floor below 
Scratch at the chain links, maybe bare my teeth for show 
Fed twice a day, I don't go hungry anymore 
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store 
I pace in circles so the camera will see 
Look hard at my stripes, there'll be no more after me 52

Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark 
Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark 
Smell something burning downwind just a little ways 
They set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days 
I have no fear of anyone, I'm dumb and wild and free 
I am a flightless bird, and there'll be no more after me 53

In Costa Rica, in a burrow underground 
Climb to the surface, blink my eyes, and look around 
I'm all alone here as I try my tiny song 
Claim my place beneath the sky but I won't be here for long 
I sang all night the moon shone on me through the trees 
No brothers left, and there'll be no more after me 54 55


If my prayer be not humble make it so 
In these last hours, if the spirit waits in check, help me let it go 
And should my suffering double let me never love you less 
Let every knee be bent, and every tongue confess 58

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free 
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me

I read the magazines somebody brought 
Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot 
And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes 
The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free 
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me

If my prayer goes unanswered that's all right 
If my path fills with darkness and there is no sign of light 
Let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high 
Until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry 59

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free 
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me


The clouds explode and then the desert blooms 
Someone will need to mop this floor for me 
When I emerge I find my car 
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive till the rain stops 
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance 
Clear as an insect's wings in sunlight 
Flip on the high stakes radio 
Try to sing the words right

Drive till the rain stops 
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him 
We were together all day 
Maybe make Culiacán 63 by sunset 
Try to anyway

High as the clouds now 
Flying 
Drive till the rain stops 
Keep driving


I saw some old friends as I came to the city gate 
They asked me where I'd been of late 
I hadn't been anywhere, but what was I going to say 
Two hopeful people, looking at me that way

You and your brother 
You both escaped the curse 
You can't comprehend what it's like 68

We stood in the sunlight, and they asked me where I'd been 
Held the gate open, and told me to come on in 
I saw the damp green grass, so nice on the other side 
Couldn't explain myself to them, but I tried

You and your brother 
You both escaped the curse 
You can't comprehend what it's like

The ground was dry but giving, the sky was nearly black 
Saw some old friends when I looked back 
Remember my old home, haven't forgotten yet 
What happens on the day when I forget

You and your brother 
You both escaped the curse 
You can't comprehend what it's like

Try to hide down in the darkness 
Get accustomed to our shapes 9 
Rained in 'til next week at the earliest 
Go through an old box full of Betamax tapes 72

Pull the blankets up to my neck 
And the screen began to glow 
I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down 73 
Wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go

And treat each crushing moment like a gift 
And wait for the fog to lift

Pretend I'm waiting for a notice 
From someone somewhere far away 
Sit here and break things while I'm waiting 
As day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day

But while I try to let the shadows mask my movements 
They're never gonna hide me like they used to 
I watched the Delta Force save everybody from that plane on fire 73 
I was watching wishing I had not lost track of you

I treat each crushing moment like a gift 
And wait for the fog to lift
