Fog lifts from the harbor 
Dawn goes down today 9 
An agent crests the shadows of a nearby alleyway

Piles of broken bricks 
Signposts on the path 
Every moment points towards the aftermath 
Yeah

Sailors straggle back 
From their nights out on the town 
Hopeless urchins from the city 
Gather around

Spies from Imperial China 10 
Wash in on the tide 
Every battle tends towards 
Surrender on both sides

And I am coming home to you 
With my own blood in my mouth 
And I am coming home to you 
If it's the last thing that I do

Bells ring in the tower 
Wolves howl in the hills 
Chalk marks show up 
On a few high windowsills

And a rabbit gives up somewhere 
And a dozen hawks descend 
Every moment leads towards its own sad end 
Yeah

Ships loosed from their moorings 
Capsize and then are gone 
Sailors without captains watch a while and then move on

And an agent crests the shadow 
And I head in her direction 
All roads lead towards 
The same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you 
With my own blood in my mouth 
And I am coming home to you 
If it's the last thing that I do

We got in your car and we hit the highway 14 
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains 
Yellow and blood-red bits 
Like a kaleidoscope

And flaming swords may guard the Garden of Eden 15 
But we consulted maps from earlier days 
Dead languages on our tongues 
Holding on to our last hope 
And the day was bright and fine 
And the highway sign 
Said, "San Bernardino welcomes you"

I checked us into our hotel and filled the bathtub 
And you got in the warm warm water 
I pulled petals from my pocket 
I loved you so much just then

And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid 
And we will never be alone in this world 
No matter what they say 
We're gonna be O.K.

We were safe inside 
And our new son cried 
"San Bernardino welcomes you"

Well they come and pull me from my house 
And they drag my body through the streets 
And the sun so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up 
In the summer air so moist and sweet

And the people all come out to cheer 
Rocks in the pathway break my skin 
And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today 
With every breath I'm drawing in

I wanna cry out 
But I don't scream and I don't shout 
And I feel so proud to be alive 
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

The crowds grow denser by the second 
As we near the center of the town 
And they dig a trench in the main square right there 
And they pick me up and throw me down

And I start laughing like a child 
And I mark their faces one by one 
Transfiguration's gonna come for me at last 
And I will burn hotter than the sun

I waited so long 
And now I taste jasmine on my tongue 
And I feel so proud to be alive 
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

Lend me your hand 
Let me look in your eyes 
As my last chance to feel human 
Begins to vaporize 
Maybe it's the heat in here 
Maybe it's the pressure 18 
You oughtta head for the exits 
The sooner the better

I am this great mass of blood and foam 
And no one in her right mind 
Would make my home her home 
My heart's an autoclave 
My heart's an autoclave

When I try to open up to you 
I get completely lost 
Houses swallowed by the earth 
Windows thick with frost 
And I reach deep down within 
But the pathways twist and turn 
And there's no light anywhere 
And nothing left to burn

And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam 
And no emotion that's worth having 
Could call my heart its home 
My heart's an autoclave 
My heart's an autoclave

I dreamt that I was perched atop 
A throne of human skulls 
On a cliff above the ocean 
Howling wind and shrieking seagulls 
And the dream went on forever 
One single static frame 
Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name 19

And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam 
And no one in her right mind 
Would make my home her home 
My heart's an autoclave 
My heart's an autoclave


There were signs up in the sky 
When we gathered by the garden wall 
Everybody on his best behavior 
Listening for the altar call

High priest of Salem in his robes 23 
Ranting at the coming of the day 
Ravens at the gates 
Frightening all the visitors away

I laid down by the water 
Dreamed a dream of where I come from 
Old things made new 24 
Waiting for you

There were wooden wind chimes rustling 
In the trees above the anthills on the dunes 
On the high winds we could hear them 
Old familiar tunes

The little bit of faith we had once 
Like the memory of a movie 
They got burned up in the great fire 
Reassembling itself slowly but surely

I laid down by the water 
Dreamed a dream of where I come from 
Old things made new 
Waiting for you


We were parked in your car 
In our neutral meeting place 
The Episcopalian 26 churchyard 
Ahaha

I had things I'd been meaning to say 
But in the dazzling winter sun that late 
I could feel them melt away 
And through the warm radio static 
I couldn't hear my stage directions 
And the fog on the windshield 
Obscured our sad reflections 
Ahhaha

I felt so desperate in your arms 
I felt so desperate in your arms

We were parked near some trees 
And the moonlight soaked the branched 
In ever deepening degrees 
Had my hand in your hair 
Trying to keep my cool 
Til it became to much to bear

When we cracked the windows open 
Well the air was just so sweet 
We could hear the cars ten feet away 
Out there on the street

I felt so desperate in your arms 
I felt so desperate in your arms 
I felt so desperate in your arms


If the strain proves too much 
Give up right away 
If the light hurts your eyes 
Stay in your room all day 
When the room fills with smoke 
Lie down on the floor 
In the declining years 
Of the long war 28

Well the blood's in the water 
And the shark's gonna come 
And we swim in the dark 
Until our bodies are numb 
Blind desert rats in the moonlight 
Too far from shore 
In the declining years 
Of the long war

Empty room with a lightbulb 
Where the phone starts to ring 
Everybody gets nervous 
Nobody says anything 
Next day someone's initials 
Show up on the door 
I think I'm gonna crack 
Can't live like this anymore 
Ugly things in the darkness 
Worse things in store 
In the declining years 
Of the long war


It's gonna be too hot to breathe today 
When everybody's out here on the streets 
Somebody's opened up a fire hydrant 
Cold water rushing out in sheets

Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey 31 
Asked me for a cigarette 
Companionship is where you find it 
So I take what I can get

Hubcaps on the cars like funhouse mirrors 
Stick to the shadows when I can 
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless 
Several hundred thousand strong 
Come out without their bandages 
Their voices raised in song

When the streetlights sputter out 
They make this awful sizzling sound 
I cast my face towards the pavement 
Too many bloodstains on the ground

Rhode Island drops into the ocean 
No place to call home anymore 32 
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

Head outside most every day 
To try to keep the wolves away 
Imagine nice things I might say 
If company should come

Woke up afraid of my own shadow 
Like genuinely afraid 
Headed for the pawnshop 
To buy myself a switchblade 
Someday something's coming 
From way out beyond the stars 
To kill us while we stand here 
It'll store our brains in Mason jars

And then the girl behind the counter 
She asks me how I feel today 
I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn 
Yeah


Children by the water banks 
Laughing long and loud 
Changbai's high fine western peaks 35 
Just beneath the clouds 
Currents in the water 
Churning in their course 
Body of a sea lion 
Head just like a horse

Preacher in the soft brown sand 
Begins to speak his piece 
High winds in the treetops 
Low flying winter geese 
No one taking pictures 
Everybody's still 
And then the water sought its course again 
The way that waters will

No one at the lakeside now 
Moon up in the sky 
Night birds in the dragon spruce 
Moaning long and high 
Back stroking on the surface 
Moonlight on its face 
Floats the Tianchi monster 
Staring into space

Out around the temple now 
Narcissus in bloom 
Censers packed with sandalwood 
Send smoke into the room 
Children in the sand outside 
On their hands and knees 
Sketching pictures all day long 
Of stranger things than these


Got out of bed 
Could not remember my own name 
Condemned to walk the soil 
Amongst all creatures wild and tame

Go where I go 
Do what I must 
Crawl starving on my belly 
Licking up the dry dust 38

I see the light in your window 
Ride the elevator to the sixth floor 
Stand with my arms at my sides 
As you open up the door

But I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe 
I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe

Alone with your bathroom mirror 
Try to get my head straight 
Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear 
Clean slate

Meet up with you in the kitchen 
Where the air is hot and dry 
Open up all the faucets 
Be fruitful and multiply 39

I stand where the flashing swords gleam 40 
And I try to shake my head clear of the dream

But I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe 
I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe

I start to sweat I can't cool down 
I'm scared of all the strangers in this town 
I try to tell you just why I've come 
It's like I've got molasses on my tongue

I made it through town somehow 
But who's gonna save me now

I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe 
I'm out of my element 
I can't breathe


Slumped up against the sink 
Hair plastered to her cheeks 
Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin 
Refugee from a disco in old East Berlin 43

Weightless 
Formless 
Blameless 
Nameless

Stray syllables were gurgling 
From her throat one at a time 
Face hidden from my view 
I let myself imagine she was you

Only weightless 
Formless 
Blameless 
Nameless

And when I washed my hands 
I ran the water hotter than I could stand

Half rising to a crouch 
Sinking back down to the floor 
In your walking keep your head low 
Try to leave no traces when you go

Stay weightless 
Formless 
Blameless 
Nameless


Long dinner with some friends 
Way out way out in Portmore 46 
Servants of the pharaoh 
Slip in through an open door

All business 
Bearing knives and zip guns 
So get on the floor now 
Every last one 
Every last one

The heat drifts 
Across the land 
If I forget you Israel 
Let me forget my right hand 47

And on the floor Michael James Williams 48 
Feels his fingers start to freeze 
And the whole scene's like a movie 
Paramedics on their knees

Try, try your whole life 
To be righteous and be good 
Wind up on your own floor 
Choking on blood

The heat drifts 
Across the land 
If I forget you Israel 
Let me forget my right hand

And the house stills smells like onions 
When the ambulance arrives 
Gabriel in postal blue 
Loads up the car and drives 
To Spanish Town 49

About three miles away 
Where will the wicked run to 
On that last day 
On that last day

The heat drifts 
Across the land 
If I forget you Israel 
Let me forget my right hand


I am ready for my closeup today 
Too long I've let my self respect stand in my way 
Well the prom queen's 
Caught in the high beams 
And the string's keen 
It's a big scene

But when the house goes up in flames 53 
No one emerges triumphantly from it 
When the scum begins to circle the drain 
Everybody loves a winner

I spent eight hours in my makeup chair 
Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair 
Well the fire's bright 
And the the frame's tight 
Try to get right 
Well we've still got life

But when the house goes up in flames 
No one emerges triumphantly from it 
When the scum begins to circle the drain 
Everybody loves a winner

But when the house goes up in flames 
When the scum begins to circle the drain


Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers 
Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris 
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes 
Don't even question your senses, you can be sure that's me

When all the pretenders to your hand 
Lie dead across the land 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
Crawling around 
Down on the ground

When the Hail Marys 56 you've been saying lose their savor 
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in 
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you 
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim

It was their love you wanted, not mine 
But when they deny your name three times 57 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
Crawling around 
Down on the ground

And I will throw you across my shoulder 
And I will bleed and I will drool 
And the cameras will slow-pan across my face 
And I will try to say something cool

Just as the hordes of thirsting demons close around us 
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun 
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them 
You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one

I may have failed you once before 
But this right here, this means war 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
I'll be the last man on earth 
Crawling around 
Down on the ground


Out by the tracks, where the sunflowers grow high and fine 
Three sets of tracks, Steve and Rochelle's, and the last one's mine 
Guy with a hat down in the weeds in a cardboard box 
Secrets to keep, records to seal up, kittens weighed down with rocks

There was a little toolshed 
Where he made us suffer 60

Back at the school, everyone looks like the enemy 
And we couldn't sleep, and I had the voices inside of me 
Steve and Rochelle and me down the well all semester long 
Back to the tracks to try and make peace but the box was gone, was gone

There was a little toolshed 
Where the sad man 61 made us suffer
