The best ever death metal band out of Denton 
Was a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school 
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff 
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom

The best ever death metal band out of Denton 
Never settled on a name 
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate 
Were Satan's Fingers, and the Killers, and the Hospital Bombers 22

Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed 
For stage lights and Learjets, 23 and fortune and fame 
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram 24 
They stenciled their drum heads and guitars with their names

And this was how Cyrus got sent to the school 25 
Where they told him he'd never be famous 
And this was why Jeff in the letters he'd write to his friend 
Helped develop a plan to get even

When you punish a person for dreaming his dream 
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you 
The best ever death metal band out of Denton 
Will in time both outpace and outlive you

Hail Satan 26 
Hail Satan tonight 
Hail Satan 
Hail, hail 27

Sophomore year 
You rushed for an average of eight and a third yards per carry 30 
All eyes were on you 
Junior year 
Blew your knee out at an out-of-town game 
Nowhere to go but down, down, down 
Nothing but the ground left for you to fall to

By July 
You'd made a whole bunch of brand-new friends 
People you used to look down on 
And you figured out 
A way to make real money 
Giving ends to your friends and it felt stupendous 31 
Chrome spokes on your Japanese bike, but 
Selling acid was a bad idea, and 
Selling it to a cop was a worse one 
And the new laws said that seventeen year olds could do federal time 
You were the first one

So I sing this song for you 
William Standaforth Donahue 32 
Your grandfather rode the boat over from Ireland, but 
You made a bad decision or two, yeah

She came in on the red-eye 33 from Dallas/Fort Worth 34 
All the way from sunny Taipei 35 
Skin the color of a walnut shell 
And a baseball cap holding down her black hair 
And she came here after midnight 
The hot weather made her feel right at home 
Come on in 
We haven't slept for weeks 
Drink some of this 
It'll put color in your cheeks

He drove in from Mexicali, 36 no worse for wear 
Money to burn, time to kill 
But five minutes looking in his eyes 
And we all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had 
We cleared a place for him to sleep in and we let 
The silence that's our trademark make its presence felt 
Come on in 
We haven't slept for weeks 
Drink some of this 
It'll put color in your cheeks

They came in by the dozens walking or crawling 
Some were bright-eyed, some were dead on their feet 
And they came from Zimbabwe, 37 or from Soviet Georgia 38 
East St. Louis, 39 or from Paris, 40, or they lived across the street 
But they came, and when they finally made it here 
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear 
Come on in 
We haven't slept for weeks 
Drink some of this 
This'll put color in your cheeks

You roared into the driveway of our 
Southwestern ranch-style house 45 
On a new Kawasaki 46 
All yellow and black 
Fresh out of the showroom 
Our house faced west 
So the big orange sun 47 
Positioned at your back 
Lit up your magnificent silhouette 
How much better, how much better, can my life get 
900 cubic centimeters of raw whining power 
No outstanding warrants for my arrest 
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa 
The pirate's life for me

I hopped on back of the bike 
Wrapped my arms around you 
And I sank my face 
Into your hair 
And then I inhaled 
As deeply as I possibly could 
You were sweet and delicious 
As the warm desert air 
And you pointed your headlamp toward the horizon 
We were the one thing in the galaxy God didn't have his eyes on 48 
900 cc's of raw whining power 
No outstanding warrants for my arrest 
High-diddle-dee-dee 
God damn 
The pirate's life for me

Down here where the heat's so fine 
I'll drink to your health, and you drink to mine 
As we try to make the money we scored out in Vegas 50 hold out for a while

We drink vodka from Russia 
We get our chocolates from Belgium 
We have our strawberries flown in from England

But none of the money we spend 
Seems to do us much good in the end 
I got a cracked engine block, both of us do 51

Yeah, the house, and the jewels, and the Italian race car 
They don't make us feel better about who we are 
I got termites in the framework, so do you

Down here where the watermelon grows so sweet 
Where I worship the ground underneath of your feet 
We are experts in the art of frivolous spending

And it's gone on like this for three years I guess 
And we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess 
And the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies is stumbling across its bleak ending

But none of the rage in our eyes 
Seems to finish it off where it lies 
I got sugar in the fuel lines, both of us do 52

Yeah, the fights, and the lies that we both love to tell 
Fail to send our love to its reward down in Hell 
I got pudding for a backbone, but so do you

La la la la, la 
Hey, hey

Two tall glasses of sweet ice tea 
Underneath the sweet gum tree 53 
And the love we once nurtured, you and me 
Disintegrating violently

Stick your tongue out 
Catch the pieces as they drift down the air 
I am too slow to catch them all 
Not too far gone to care

Two slow summer hours spent peeking at the bones 
Figuring the interest on delinquent loans 
Speaking in sad and mournful tones 
Trying to squeeze tears out of mute stones

Wet your finger, place it toward the wind 
Feel disaster in the air 
We are far too slow to outrun it now 
Not too far gone to care

Wind out of Oklahoma 56 this morning 
Smelled like blood and smoke 
And the crows discussed their future in the 
Branches of their Louisiana live oak 57

And the limbs are strong and heavy and its 
Leaves are all aglow 
And the branches brush the upper air 
But the roots reach down to where the bad people go 58

And what will I do with you 
Pink and blue 
True gold 
Nine days old

Nice new clothes on you 
And an old cardboard produce box for a cradle 
I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup 
And I fed you there at the kitchen table

Crows outside complaining about the 
Finer points of local politics 
Strange wind all full of new smells 
Rust and fur and reception sticks 59

And what will I do with you 
Pink and blue 
True gold 
Nine days old

We live high, our love gorges 
On the alcohol we feed it 
And it grows all fat and friendly 
We have surplus if we need it 
We hold on as hard as we can 
Our knuckles are white

We write letters to each other 
Invent secrets to confess to 
I learn foreign and exotic 
Terms of endearment by which to address you 
We feed fresh fruit to one another 
We stay up all night

And I am healthy, I am whole 
But I have poor impulse control 
And I want to go home 
But I am home

We are strong and we are faithful 
We are guardians of a rare thing 
We pay close, careful attention 
To the news the morning air brings 
We show great loyalty 
To the hard times we've been through

We are filled with riches and wonders 
Our love keeps the things it finds 
And we dance like drunken sailors 
Lost at sea, out of our minds 
You find shelter somewhere in me 
I find great comfort in you

And I keep you safe from harm 
You hold me in your arms 
And I want to go home 
But I am home

We took a weekend, drove to Provo 62 
The snow was white and fluffy 
But a weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us 
The gray sky was vast and real cryptic above me

I wanted you 
To love me like you used to do

We took two weeks in the Bahamas 63 64 
Went out dancing every night 
Tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things 
Most of the time I guess I felt all right

But I wanted you 
To love me like you used to do

But you cannot run 
And you cannot hide 
From the wreck we've made of our house 
And from the mess inside

We went down to New Orleans 65 
One weekend in the spring 
Looked hard for what we'd lost 
It was painful to admit it, but we couldn't find a thing

I wanted you 
To love me like you used to do

We went to New York City in September 
Took the train out of Manhattan to the Grand Army stop 66 
Found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago 
When I'd felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop

I wanted you 
To love me like you used to do

But I cannot run 
And I can't hide 
From the wreck we've made of our house 
And from the mess inside

After three nights in jail 
I head north from Toyahvale 69 
Switch to 285 70 in Pecos, 71 head up to Red Bluff 72 
My walk's real steady and my eyes are real cold, but I 
Feel like I'm all of sixteen years old 73 
Lost in a Travelodge 74 with the television on, with the sound down 
I don't feel so tough 
Old issues of Sunset magazine 75 to read 
Sleep for twelve hours 
Dream about home

I have no place to go, so I 
Drive up to New Mexico 76 
Fix my eyes in the rearview when I cross the state line 
And I panic, I guess, and although it's quite late, I 
Take the first exit to 128 77, I am 
Coming back to Midland, 78 and I hope you won't mind 
Polaroids 79 of the two of us 
Scattered on the passenger seat 
I drive slowly 
And evenly 
And I dream about home

I found an old rock 
In the dry dirt outside 
The door of my motel room 
It was a triangle with soft rounded edges 
And a split down the middle of one corner 
It was darker than English moss 
Green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume

I waited for you 
But I never told you where I was 
It was you who taught me how 
To write these kinds of equations 
I waited on the steps for you 
And I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot 
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations 
Distant stations

I saw the sky break 
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rose bushes by the motel office 
Missed him by a good yard or two 
I sang old songs from nowhere 
Los Angeles, Albuquerque 81 
Said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry 
And I prayed real hard for you

I waited for you 
But I never told you where I was 
It was you who taught me how 
To write this kinds of equation 
I waited on the steps for you 
And I hid in the bushes whenever I saw a car pull into the parking lot 
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations 
Distant stations

Will I see you there when that final trumpet blows 84 
Will I see you there when that final trumpet blows 
If I don't see you there 
I will run a comb through my hair 
And I will wait 
I will wait 
I will wait

Will you walk on in when the angel summons you 
Will you walk on in when the angel summons you 
If I don't see you go 
I will let the minions flow 
And I will wait 
I will wait 
I will wait

Down in Dealey Plaza, 85 the tourists mill about 
Down in Dealey Plaza, the tourists mill about 
And I am far from where where we live 
And I have not learned how to forgive 
But I will wait 
I will wait 
I will wait 
Yeah

One a week, I make the drive two hours east 
To check the Austin 88 post office box 
And I take the detour through our old neighborhood 
See all the Chevy Impalas 89 in their front yards up on blocks 
And I park in an alley and I read through the postcards 
You continue to send 
Where as indirectly as you can, you ask what I remember 
I like these torture devices from my old best friend 
Well, I'll tell you what I know 
Like I swore I always would 
I don't think it's gonna do you any good 
I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok 90 
Down toward the water

I always get a late start 
When the sun's going down 
And the traffic's thinning out 
And the glare is hard to take 
I wish the west Texas highway 91 was a Möbius strip 92 
I could ride it out forever when I feel my heart break 
I almost swear I hear it happen 
It's that clear and that hard 
I come in off the highway 
And I park in my front yard 
I fall out of the car 
Like a hostage from a plane 
Think of you a while 
Start wishing it would rain 
And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok 
Down toward the water

I come into the house 
Put on a pot of coffee 
Walk the floors a little while 
I set your postcard on the table 
With all the others like it 
I start sorting through the pile 
I check the pictures and the postmarks and the captions and the stamps 
For signs of any pattern at all 
When I come up empty-handed the feeling almost overwhelms me 
I let a few of my defenses fall 
And I smile a bitter smile 
It's not a pretty thing to see 
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983 
And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok 
Down, down toward the water

After one long season of waiting 
After one long season of wanting 
I am breaking open 
My insides, pink and raw 
And it hurts me when I move my jaw 
But I am taking tiny steps forward 
And I, I feel sure that my wounds will heal 
And I, I will bloom here in my room 
With a little water 
And a little bit of sunlight 
And a little bit of tender mercy 
Tender mercy

The big trucks come up the highway 
And the big wheels rattle my windows 
And night, night comes to Texas 
After one blind season alone in here 
After one long sweltering summer 
I, I'm going to find the exit 
And I will go to the house of a friend I know 
And I will let myself forget 
With a little water 
And a little bit of sunlight 
And a little bit of tender mercy 
Tender mercy

The daylily 98 withers 99 
Heat kills off all the grain 
Just when you think 
It's never gonna rain 
The rain comes 
The rain comes 
It floods the town 
Kills everybody in it

The dog runs in circles 
Parolees all skip town 
The heat goes on forever and ever and ever 
Shows no signs of slowing down 
And then the rain comes 
The rain comes 
It shows no 
Signs of stopping

Maybe I didn't get enough milk when I was a baby 
Maybe I never learned the value of a penny 
Maybe I listened to that first Black Sabbath album, the one with the witch on the front 102
One time too many 
I think something's wrong with me 
I think something's wrong with me 
I think something's glued-down wrong permanently

Maybe it's the things I never learned how to do 
Maybe it's the things I learned to do real well 
Maybe it's the Irish whiskey that I like to drink 
Maybe it's the California Zinfandel 103 
But I think something's wrong with me 
I think something's glued-down wrong, maybe permanently

I'm gonna tell you once, you oughta listen 
You came here for comfort, you came to the wrong place 
I got a strong stomach and a murmur in my heart 104 
I got a tremor in my hand, muscle twitches in my face 
And I think something's wrong with me 
I think something's snapped-on wrong, maybe permanently 
Yup

The summer came in carrying spring in its mouth 
Held it up for everyone to see 
This is the time when all our plans and schemes 
Melt down into listless anarchy 
Historically, anyway, that's been the case 
But this year there's a new pink sheen on your face 
Like the color of a secret flower 
That grows tall and moist and incorruptible 108 
Indonesia 
Indonesia

The season tunneled forward like a moth through grain 
Its hunger was an all-consuming mindless thing 
And you slept for twelve to fourteen hours at a stretch 
I wondered what the weather in the fall was gonna bring 
And then you said you dreamt of cowboys that were zombies in disguise 
Well, I knew fall was never coming, it was written on your eyes 
Like the mist that hangs there in the air 
On the mountainside where rare and nameless flowers grow 
In Indonesia 
Indonesia

Midland 109 110 78
Come and stay with me as long as you like 
I live outside of town where the straight highway curves 
For three years I lived next door to the airport 
So nothing you can say to me can get on my nerves 
Stay 'til you feel your legs underneath you again 
I've got room in my house for you

I got a Kenmore single room window unit air conditioner 111 
Cools down the place in the full heat of day 
And a family of possums have made their home underneath the front steps 
They are majestic in their own beady-eyed homey way 
Stay until you can breathe like normal people do 
I've got room in my house for you

They tore down the airport in 1981 
This is where I came when I ran out of places to run

Come, come, come and stay with me out here away from things 
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear 
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live 
Sky's purple from six in the evening 'til midnight out here 
Stay 'til the world goes down in flames 
I've got room, room in my house for you

Tape Travel is Lonely 112 113 114
Peppers on the plants 
Plums, tomatoes ripening on the vine 
Midsummer evenings on the back porch 
Barbecued sweet corn, sweet white wine 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Bottle after bottle of the cheap stuff 
Feeling two degrees north of all right 
Heaven help us, heaven help us 
We're all gonna die tonight 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Party goes on 'til the end of August 
The tensions build, the air currents throb 
Mosquitoes suck the blood out of my body 
Why don't they finish the job 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you 
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Where the dry dust turns the sunset pink 
Where all summer long, it's so hot that you can't think straight 
Where we pump water from a well by hand 
Half a world away from the old promised land 
We understand that we've been given 
A new covenant, a real sharp one 
And we spend our days and nights 
Gaining new appreciation of its finer points 
And waiting for the dead 
To rise up from their graves 
Waiting for Jesus 
To come along and save us 118 
And biding our time 
Biding our time 
Biding our time as best we know how

Where the Texas doughboys 119 used to play 
Before the wind blew everything away 
Where we came to get away from our friends 
Where we tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end 
We know our jokes are funny 
But in all the wrong ways 
And we rent old George Romero movies 120 
Relish the short time left 
Waiting for the dead 
To rise up from their graves 
Waiting for Jesus 
To come along and save us 
Yes, and biding our time 
Biding our time 
Biding our time as best we know how
