I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside 
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail 
And I steal down to Business 15-501 7 
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail

And somebody stops to pick me up 
But he drops me off just down the block 
And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe 
Wild sage growing in the weeds

Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps 
Headed vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes 
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands breaking my fall 
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies

And then I think I hear angels in my ears 
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror 
And along the highway where unlucky stray dogs bleed 
Wild sage growing in the weeds

And some days I don't miss my family 
And some days I do 
Some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder 
Most days I know it's not true

I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face 
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides 
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand 
'Til it doesn't sting so much and until the blood's dried

And when somebody asks if I'm OK 8 
I don't know what to say 9 
And along the highway 
From cast-off innumerable seeds 
Wild sage growing in the weeds


Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees 
Sometime after midnight the ground is gonna freeze 
Birds in the frosty air 
What are they doing there?

Greenhouse full of butcher's-broom 12 13 
Breeze is at my back 
Sometime before the sun comes up 
The earth is gonna crack

I look down at my hands 
Like they were mirrors

Fresh coffee at sunrise 
Warm my lips against the cup 
Been waiting such a long time now 
My number's finally coming up

All the neighbors come on out to their front porches 
Waving torches

Half Dead 14
It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today 
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away 
Try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine 
Focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means

Can't get you 
Out of my head 
Lost without you 
Half dead

Took my spot at the window 
Looked out at the road 
Dots and dashes of traffic 
Like a message in code

And whole boxes of memories 
Wrapped up at the curb 
I sang songs to myself that 
Didn't have any words

Can't get you 
Out of my head 
Lost without you 
Half dead

Stole out to the back yard late last night 
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight 
Rising like giants from the cold earth 
What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?

Can't get you 
Out of my head 
Lost without you 
Half dead


I will rise up early 
And dress myself up nice 
And I will leave the house 
And check the deadlock twice 
And I will find a crowd 
And blend in for a minute 
And I will try to find 
A little comfort in it

And I will get lonely 
And gasp for air 
And send your name up from my lips 
Like a signal flare

And I will go downtown 
Stand in the shadows of the buildings 
And button up my coat 
Trying to stay strong, spirit willing 
And I will come back home 
Maybe call some friends 
Maybe paint some pictures 
It all depends

And I will get lonely 
And gasp for air 
And look up at the high windows 
I see your face up there


A bad dream shook me in my sleep 
And I woke up sweating 
Ran through the dark to the shower 
Already forgetting 
Try to think good thoughts 
Trying to find my way clear 
Let the room fill with steam 
Traced pictures on the mirror

Ghosts and clouds 
And nameless things 
Squint your eyes and hope real hard 
Maybe sprout wings

I clawed my way to the living room window 
Stood there in the cold 
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance 
Hard to hold 
I thought of old friends 
The ones who'd gone missing 17 
Said all their names three times 18 
Phantoms in the early dark 
Canaries in the mines 19

Ghosts and clouds 
And nameless things 
Squint your eyes and hope real hard 
Maybe sprout wings


I went down to the gas station 
For no particular reason 
Heard the screams from the high school 
It's football season

Empty lot the station faces 
Will probably be there forever 
I climbed over the four foot fence 
I was trying to sever the tether

Moon in the sky 
Cold as a stone 
Spend each night in your arms 
Always wake up alone

I lay down in the weeds 
It was a real cold night 
I was happy 'til the overnight attendant 
Switched on the floodlight

Walking home I was talking to you under my breath 
Saying things I would never say directly 
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead 
Kinda wished they'd come and get me

Frost on the sidewalk 
White as a bone 
Tried to get close to you again 
Always wake up alone

And as I was crossing our doorstep 
I hesitated just a moment there 
Remembered the day we moved into our small house 
'Til the vision got too vivid to bear

You were almost asleep 
Halfway undressed 
I lay right down next to you 
Held your head against my chest

And a guy with any kind of courage 
Would maybe stop to think the matter through 
Maybe hold you still and raise the question 
Instead of blindly holding onto you

But we crank up the heat 
And you giggle and moan 
Spend all night in the company of ghosts 
Always wake up alone


Autumn came around like a drifter to an on-ramp 
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain 
Took to walking barefoot around town 
Melodies from grade school kicking in my brain

Saw you on the crosstown bus today 
You were reading a magazine 
I turned my face away 
And I shut my eyes tight 
Dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light 24 
On dark hillsides in the hidden places

The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house 
And I got off at the corner 
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands 
And I wished I was someone else 
And I wished it was warmer

And when I got home I thought about you 
Like a desperate policeman searching for clues 
And I almost passed out just then 
And I shut my eyes again 
Headed for the dark hillsides 
In the hidden places


No one washed behind my ears 
High in the trees alone for years 
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons 27 
Watching them go where they will go

Face in the leaves, song in my throat 
Fall through the air, hoping to float 
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy 
Too heavy to carry 
Watching them go where they will go


On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time 
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared 
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately 
Not being used to being the only person there 
Mm-mm

The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it 
But I drank it all just 'cause you hate it when I let things go to waste 
And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost at the mall 
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space 30

And I sang 
Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do? 
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time 
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat 
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened 
I practically ran from the living room out into the street

And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend 
And the world in its cold way started coming alive 
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train 
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang 
Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do? 
What do I do without you?


When the villagers come to my door 
I will hide underneath the table in the dining room 
Knees drawn up to my chest

When the villagers come to my door 
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach 
Ah hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah

Waiting for the front door to splinter 
Waiting all winter

When the villagers come to my door 
I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor 
And my eyes closed

And no one knows how to keep secrets 'round here 
They tell everyone everything soon as they know 
And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?

Waiting for the front door to splinter 
Waiting all winter


Sun just clearing the tree line when my day begins 
Slippery ice on the bridges, north-eastern wind coming in 
You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel 36 
Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel

Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo 
On her arm, its head flaring out like a parachute

Prisms in the dewdrops in the underbrush 
Skate case sailors' purses 37 floating down in the black needlerush 38 
Higher than the stars I will set my throne 39 
God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones 40

Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo 
And try to hear the garbled transmissions come through


The day I turned my back on all you people 
I felt an itching in my thumbs 
Salt air like a broadcast from the distant dark beyond 
When my transformation comes

I went down to the warm warm water 
Saw a pelican fly past 
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me 
I went wading through the grass

And no one was gonna come and get me 
There wasn't anybody gonna know 
Even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake 
Every single place I go

And it was cool and it was quiet 
In the humid marsh down there 
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water 
Felt it gumming up my hair

The sun was sinking into the Atlantic 
The last time that I turned my back on you 
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under 
It was the best that I could do

And I said, let them all fare better than your servant 
The reeds all pricking at my skin 
Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you 
All that water rushing in


I am hiding in the house 
Someone's coming through the gate 
When the doorbell sounds like an air raid siren 
I am lying in wait

People used to come around 
They fish-eyed and they rubbernecked 
Anyone who'd come to visit now 
Is automatically a suspect

I creep up to the window 
Me and my buzzing brain 
And we watch two Jehovah's witnesses 45 
Retreating down the lane

I'm not coming out yet 
It's too cold 
Leave me alone 'til I learn 
How to spin straw into gold 46

I put on night vision goggles 
Work my way along the wall into the kitchen 
As soon as the first snow fell this year 
My fingers started itching

And I locked up the doors 
And I sealed up all the windows 
And friends came by sometime for a while 
I never let 'em in though

And then they stopped, then they stopped at last 
And now it's just us three 
These walls and the Church of Jesus Christ 
Of the Latter-day Saints and me 47

And I'm not coming out yet 
It's too cold 
Leave me alone 'til I learn 
How to spin straw into gold


You went away to Stockholm 50 for a week 
You came back with some scratch-marks on your cheeks 
The towers line the highway and they cry 
From deep down in their guts until they die

The water tower crew are total devils 
Toxicity near saturation levels 
I rise up and greet the day 
See the serpents rising from the clay

You were headed down to Salzburg 51 for the night 
All my hair was turning white 
You and your crew were good to go 
So many people that we'll never really know

I saw the city men, they make me laugh 
Digging up the cables, cutting them in half 
I watch the ancient sun until it falls 
See the serpents coming through the walls


"Two, three, four."

You clean out your junk drawer 
You mop up some blood, while the 
First of some new creatures 
Rises from the mud

Cursing the moment 
That saw him draw breath 
The ghost on your doorstep is starving 
To death

You spray down the windows 
You wipe them all clean, and you 
Douse your old clothing 
With fresh gasoline

And the ghost on your doorstep 
Is soaked wet with rain 
And he clutches his stomach 
And howls at the pain

And you can stay busy all day 
He's never going away

So let all the lights blaze 
Keep your heart light 
Play really loud music 
All hours of the night

And when you set the table 
Set it for two 
The ghost on your doorstep has to eat 
Same as you 
Same as you
