We broke the doorknob off of the door 
The door swung open easily 
You sauntered into the poorly lit store 
And looked around lazily 
We stole every bit of candy they had inside 
Gobbled it all up greedily on our three-month ride 17 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

We headed out to the getaway car 
And hit the open road 
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face 
But I could not break the code 
We had hot caramels sticking to our teeth 
And the only love I've ever know burning underneath 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone 
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

There was a new song on the air 
I saw you coming across the square 
And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky 
As the rest of my life went by

You had your warm hand on my face 
I took your index finger in between my teeth 
And I held it gently in place 
It was resting lightly on my tongue in there 
I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air 
There but for the grace of the lord of song 20 
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along 
You had your cardigan on

I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone 
I remember your eyelids 
I remember your body now

Well, you were standing in the door 
Well, I wondered what you were waiting for 
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine 
Out of control

Well I was trying to think of something clever 
You were saying nothing whatsoever 
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil 
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil

We'd come from California 
The air around you was familiar to me now 
If you were gazing westward 
I was looking at you again

All I know 
Is I'm in love you 
Even though 
You say that we are through 
I know without your love 
I just can't go on 
I wonder where our love has gone

Always thought 
You'd love me more and more 
Never dreamed 
You'd ever let me go 
I know without your love 
I just can't go on 
I wonder where our love has gone

Now, what did I do 
And what did I say 
That ever could leave you 
To treat me this way 
If I've been untrue 
I'm willing to pay 
And darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say

So darling, please 
Wherever you may be 
Hear my plea 
And hurry home to me 
I know without your love 
I just can't go on 
I wonder where our love has gone

One day in September 
You come here 
You pull my head down 
And you whisper in my ear

And you tell me the sidewalk 
Is as far as the world really goes 
But that's a secret 
Everybody knows

You hold my head in your hands 
You say my name 
How is it that though you say it some twenty-thousand times 
It's never quite the same

And you tell me that Hercules 
Died burned consumed by an article of his own clothing 26 
That's something 
I'd rather not be reminded of

The last of the repercussions 
Died off real slow 
The sky was still 
And the cold sun sank down beneath the snow

I hung by my hand 
From the tree outside 
And I looked on the whole wide world

The voices came quietly 
I shut them down 
A tricky young southernly wind 
Came at me with its high whistling sound 
I turned around to face it 
With real arrogance burning inside 
And I drank in the whole wide world

I am wearing 
A white long-sleeve button-down 
The pink colors behind the clouds tonight 
Mirror the softer shades of your nightgown 
As the neurotransmitters go crazy inside of me 
You swear you're leaving town 
Empty promises 
Empty promises

I am watching 
The way the wind seems to pass straight through your body 
When you run your fingernail along my neck 
And you spill some water on me 
You say you're as good as gone 
Well, don't look now, but here comes the dawn 
Empty promises 
Empty promises 
Empty promises 
Empty promises

I cut down that withered peach tree 
Just like you asked me to 
And I hacked it into pieces 
Set it on fire with your face in plain view 
At the near window where you stood 
Watching me split the wood 
I will do as I am told 
I will keep away the cold

The fire pit in the snow 
Gave off a rich bright orange-red glow 
And a familiar scent rose up into the air 
And I remembered something special from a long time ago 
You opened up the door 
Stepped away from the killing floor 
Your footprint on the snow was fresh and new 
When you touched me I felt fire coming through 
I will do as I am told 
I will keep away the cold 
I will do as I am told 
I will keep away the cold

The ghostly sing-song 
Of the children playing double Dutch 37 
I felt the wind come through the window 
I felt it turn around and switch back 
In the second-story room 
In Jamaica, Queens 38 
Your hair was dripping wet 
Your skin was clean 
And the children skipping rope 
Tripled their speed 
You were all I'd ever wanted 
You were all I'd ever need 
In New York City in the middle of July 
The air was heavy and wet 
The air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine 
I will know who you are yet, I will know who you are yet

We were real hungry and half dead 
When you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread 
And in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit 
Moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited 
Ah

We were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm 
I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm 
You pressed your soft cheek up against my gut 
Pure gold, nothing but gold 
And I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie 
'Cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you

I cut myself a two foot switch 45 
From some tropical hardwood nearby 
And the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously 
Through the air from a thousand miles away 
The monkeys jumped from tree to tree 
It sent a deathly chill through me 
In Bolivia

Wildcats I had never seen 
Claimed places in my room 
And animal noises rang through the thick brush 
Like voices from the tomb 
I saw the freshly-polished chrome 
Gleaming in the midday sun 
And I knew that you were coming home 
To Bolivia

Hey, hey

I was sitting at the edge of the marsh 
When the council came to bring me the news 
They handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses 49 and they 
Gave me the ceremonial shoes

Goodbye, young Danish women 
Goodbye, Danish sky 
Goodbye, cold air, I am going away 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 50

I know you can see Mars 
In the sky tonight 
I know you can see Venus rising 
And veering off to the right 
Can you see that young star overhead 
It's the one that designed my undoing

I know that in California 
The waves break on the beach 
And I know that the foam on the breaking waves 
Is as white as household bleach 
But do you see that particular white right now 
It's the color of the young star, coming on down 
I got joy, joy, joy in my soul tonight 
I got joy, joy, joy in my arms all right 
Although you treat me badly 
I love you madly 
You really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me 53

When I ask you to look at me 
You look away 
I ask you to tell me something nice once 
You come at me with all your hot lights on display 
I know you're changing 
Damn you 
I know you're changing 
God damn you for that

And the snow stacked up outside 
You looked around 
I could see it from the window 
I could the snow coming down 
I know you're changing 
Damn you 
I know you're changing 
God damn you

In an hour or two 
The sun will rise on you 
And it will be clear what has happened between us 
In an hour or two 
The wind will come through the window 
The wind will tear through the house 
I am creeping up the staircase 
One step at a time 
Bringing roses and chocolate 
Roses and chocolate 
Roses 
Roses 
Roses

There's a capsicum pepper plant 58 growing 
Out in the backyard 
There's a capsicum pepper plant growing 
Out in the backyard 
And I, I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done 
I can't believe the thing I've done

There's a friend of mine living in Dallas 59 
About a two days' drive from here 
Got a friend of mine living in Dallas 
And that's a two days' drive from here 
And I, I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done 
I can't believe the thing I've done

And there's a cold wind blowing 
And there's a silver bell hanging 
And there's a silver bell ringing 
And I, I am a monster 
I can't believe the thing I've done 
I can't believe the thing I've done

Yeah

Hurry the bottle mama, it's grapefruit wine 
Kick off your high-heeled sneakers, it's party time 
The girls don't seem to care what's on 
As long as it plays 'til dawn 
No static at all

Give her some fucked-up music, 64 she treats you nice 
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice 
The girls don't seem to care tonight 
As long as the mood is right 
No static at all 
No static at all 
Hey

I went down to the basement 
To check up on the sour mash 69 
I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub 
It was bubbling 
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down 
I saw the dust devils swarming around 
Incoming sunbeams cut them apart 
And I watched a shadow pass across my heart 
You were upstairs in the kitchen 
With your head against the sink 
Trying to cool down 
Trying to cool down

I know you don't believe me, but I could hear you breathing 
I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething 
With new life, new life all around 
I stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down 
You were upstairs in the kitchen 
With your head against the sink 
Trying to cool down 
Trying to cool down 
Yeah

Rainbows shone on the glass 
Dewdrops gathered on the grass 
And the yellow sun came into view 
Another goddamn message from you 
Well, despite your best efforts 
I feel all right 
Against my better judgment 
I feel all right 
Despite your random acts of violence 
I feel all right 
Despite the force of your fury 
I feel all right

You're mean to me 
Why must you be mean to me 71 
You shouldn't forget, you see 
What you mean to me
