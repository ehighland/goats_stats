Down in the South Bronx 10 
Down home 
Saw you walking down the street again 
Saw you looking sweet again

I saw you coming through 
I turned my head away from you 
Why do you come here 
Why do you come around 11 
Why'd you go home 
Why'd you head on home to Rockaway? 12

When the seashells crumbled in your hand 
You looked up at me 
And the sands shifting underneath your feet 
Softened for you and incredibly 
The sun went through from the sky 
And I was certain I was going to cry 
But then you reached up and you reached out 
We'd been staring at the water all day 
And then you touched me, you were golden 
You were giving the game away

When the sand crabs ran across your face 
You didn't even twitch 
And a salt scent came across the water 
Impossibly rich 
Impossibly cold 
We were just nineteen years old 
But then you reached up 
And you reached out 
We'd been staring at the water all day 
And then you touched, me you were golden 
You were giving the game away

I hear you starting up again 
I see you standing on the deck 
I hear your voice start to carry 
I see the veins throbbing in your neck

And I know what you're saying 
And I know what you're saying it for 
But I'm not listening 
I'm not listening anymore

And I see you come toward me 
I see the sun climb down the sky 
I hear your voice getting faster and louder 
I see a stranger in your eyes

And I know what you're saying 
And I know what you're saying it for 
But I'm not listening 
I'm not listening anymore

Gotta keep moving 
Gotta keep moving 
Blues falling down like hail 
Gotta keep moving 
Blues falling down like hail 
And the daylight keeps moving 
There's a hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow were Christmas Day 15 
If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow were Christmas Day 
And tomorrow were Christmas Day All I would need is my little sweet rider 
And the world would fade away

Gotta keep moving 
Gotta keep moving 
Blues falling down like hail 
Gotta keep moving 
Blues falling down like hail 
And the daylight keeps to worrying me 
There's a hellhound on my trail, yeah

When you saw the evening star 16 
Shining in the freezing sky 
I saw something dark and silent 
Passing by

Full moon 
Deep grass 
Cold water

When you said your name out loud 
Something broke inside me 
Nothing new to take a hold of 
No new world to hide me

Full moon 
Deep grass 
Cold water

Full moon 
Deep grass 
Cold water

Your house is depressing 
Your house is dirty 
Why don't you come outside a little while? 
Why don't you step out into the sun? 
Let me take you down 
Let me ease you around Montgomery 17

And out there on the front porch 
Your hair shines in the sun 
And I can see the sun gathering on your eyes 
What the hell are you looking at? 
Let me take you down 
Let me ease you around Montgomery

Deep is the midnight sea 
Warm is the fragrant night 
Sweet are your lips to me 
Soft as the moon and sand

Oh, when shall we meet again 
When the night has left us 
Will the spell remain

The waves invade the shore 
Though we may kiss no more 
Night is at our command 
Moon and sand

The waves invade the shore 
And though we may kiss no more 
Night is at our command 
Moon and sand

The wind blew in across the water 
And the wind blew through your hair 
And I walked around the lake's perimeter 
And then I saw you there

I will grab you by the ears 
I will grab you by the ears 
I will grab you by the ears 
And you will know something 
You will know something

I saw the birds fly out across the lake 
I saw the birds go by 
And I walked around the lake's perimeter 
And I saw the lake reflected in your eyes

I will grab you by the ears 
I will grab you by the ears 
I will grab you by the ears 
And you will know something 
You will know something

I saw you in the blazing light 
When the lotus 22 caught fire 
In the middle of the night 
It froze me 
It froze me

I saw you coming closer real slow 
You grabbed hold 
I let go 
Yeah I saw you in the blazing light 
I saw you 
I saw you all right 
It froze me 
It froze me 
It froze me 
It froze me

I saw the ceiling spin 
And I saw the room shift 
And I watched the television flicker 
And I let my mind drift 
I would give anything in the world up for you 
But I will not stop

I saw the blossom form 
And I saw the screen glow 
And I let my arm fall to my side 
And I took one step back 
And I would give anything in the world up for you 
But I will not stop

When I came back from Finland 
The taxi took me down the street 
I saw the red flowers growing like they used to 
By the roadside in the smothering summer heat

You were standing out in front of the house 
With your floral print dress on 
And you had questions only a masochist would ask 
Written all over your big brown eyes 
And the moon is high over Iowa at night 
And the moon is high over Iowa at night 
And I brought you a blanket 
Hand woven, hand dyed 
The moon is high over Iowa at night

I know what I want 
And I know what we need 
When the first fruits of the harvest 
Begin to blacken and bleed 
And the purple fruit 25 gives way when you press it 
Even so slightly 
And through the thatches behind the green leaves 
We heard the fire-eyed macaw 26 sing as evil as you please 
And his little song 
Is a very pretty song 
But it's something I won't stand for

And as the sun rises over Columbia 
I know we're done for

When the holes started forming in the tent 
And you wondered out loud where the sunlight went 
I had a mind to tell you 
But I didn't want to hurt you 
And if I knew how to form the words 
I would ask you what you'd come for

But as the sun rises over Columbia 
I know we're done for 
Yeah, as the sun rises over Columbia 
I know we're done for 
As the sun rises over Columbia 
I know we're done for

When I saw it on the bakery carousel 
I knew I had to have it for my own 
I eased it out 
And I brought it home 
Why don't you try some 
I already had some myself

Is that the most delicious thing 
You ever tasted in your life 
Is that the most delicious thing 
You ever tasted in your life

And then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat 
And then I felt the colder sadness taking hold 
I knew I had to have it for my own 
Why don't you try some 
Why don't you try some

Is that the most delicious thing 
You ever tasted in your life 
Is that the most delicious thing 
You ever tasted in your life

And then I saw the snow against the window 
And then I saw the snow hit the window 
And then I saw the snow brush against the window 
And then I saw the snow in here

You were all dressed in green 
Clouds bounced against the edges of the sky 
You had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen 
We saw the world passing by

There was an ocean's droning 
Though we were nowhere near the shore 
We heard each other giggling and moaning 
Then we couldn't hear each other anymore 
Yeah

When my head was resting on your breastbone 
I could hear your beating heart 
Twenty-four hours later you had left me completely alone 
I heard the whole world come apart

And you were all dressed in green 
Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star 
You know, you know what I mean 
Yeah, I remember who you are

Listen, you can tell your lawyer 
That he can go to hell 
'Cause I can take whatever you are offering up 
Reasonably well 
And if four long years come to nothing 
That's all right 
But it's your birthday 
It's your birthday tonight 
And I went to buy you something 
But I caught myself in time 
And nothing makes any sense anymore 
But everything rhymes

Die hard 
Die kicking 
Old habit of mine 
Die hard 
Die kicking 
Old habit of mine 
Die hard 
Die hard 
Die kicking

I've been drinking that coffee you sent me from Thailand 
I've been watching the lamps burn 
I've been listening to the wind chime 
I've been waiting my turn

And I'm coming to you 
I am coming to you 
I am coming to you

And I heated the milk until it boiled and I drank it down 
And I stepped outside and I checked my reflection in the rain 
There were voices on the wind 
Winter coming on in 
And I made myself up again, brand new

And I am broken and I am tired 
And I'm coming to you with my mouth 
Dripping

We heard the rats in the rafters scurry by 
And we wondered about the color of the sky outside 
In Warsaw 33 in 1939 34 
It was all right just to be alive 
It was good that you were mine 
And you held your hands up 
To form a heart in the air 
You held your hands up with your thumbs touching 
They formed a heart in the air

Through the piece missing from the brick wall 
We had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the hall 
And you held your hands up where I could see them in the dark 
They formed a heart in the air 
You held your hands up 
And they formed a heart in the air

I heard the old songs radiating from you 
I heard the old songs radiating from you

There was a barn owl trapped in the rafters 
The ground underneath us was wet and cold 
We heard the owl thrashing about 
Trying desperately to get out 
We stood outside and watched the night unfold

We watched the sun go down on Scotland 
And I watched the moon come up over you 
When a pack of dogs went silently past us 
We knew we'd been given fair warning 
But that was the only thing we knew

And you threw all your luggage out onto the water 
And I tore the shirt away from my back 
The cold came on with a new found intensity 
And you pressed your warm body against me 
And I loved you so much it was making me sick

And we watched the sun go down on Scotland 
We were glad that we'd left Oklahoma behind 
I took your hips in my hands and I threw you down 
To the new found rich brown deep wet ground 
Had a vision of you burning on my mind

We watched the sun go down on Scotland 
And I watched the moon come up over you 
When a pack of dogs went silently past us 
We knew we'd been given fair warning 
But that was the only thing we knew
