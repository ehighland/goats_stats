Small screen, July evening view 
Up and down Grand Avenue 
Where the legends get made 
Out with the boys' brigade 
Part of the motorcade

Flew home from Texas last night 
Slept on the flight 
Work like a dog all day 
Born to chase cars away 
Die on the road someday

I try to remember what life was like long ago 
But it's gone, you know 
Climb the turnbuckle high 
Take two falls out of three 
Black out for local TV

Stand in that cold empty hall 
Wait for your name to get called 
Burn like hillsides on fire 
In the squall of the ringside choir 
High as a wire

Nearly drive Danny's nose back into his brain 
All the cheap seats go insane

Keep my eyes open and try to think straight 
No one drives on the 60 this late 
I feel like the last person alive 
Francisquito to Glenshaw Drive

I try to remember to write in the diary That my son gave me 
Climb the turnbuckle high 
Take two falls out of three 
Black out for local TV


Born down in El Paso, where the tumbleweeds blow 
To the middleweight champ of all of Mexico 
Dad fought many bloody battles, and he raised four sons 
Chavo was the oldest one

Old man Gory could pop, like a live grenade 
Raised his boys in the way of the trade 
HÃ©ctor and Mando, young Eddie G 
But Chavo meant the most to me

Look high, it's my last hope 
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope

He came from Texas seeking fortune and fame 
Rose pretty quickly to the top of the game 
Defender of the downtrodden, king of the hill 
Tag team champion with Al Madril

Before a black-and-white TV in the middle of the night 
I'm lying on the floor, I'm bathed in blue light 
The telecast's in Spanish, I can understand some 
And I need justice in my life, here it comes

Look high, it's my last hope 
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope

Red Shoes Dugan, holding his arm high all out of breath 
I hated all of Chavo's enemies, I would pray nightly for their deaths 
Descending like fire on the people who deserved it most 
Almost completely unknown outside of Texas and on the West Coast

He was my hero back when I was a kid 
You let me down but Chavo never once did 
You called him names to try to get beneath my skin 
Now your ashes are scattered on the wind

I heard his son got famous and he went nationwide 
Coast to coast, with his dad by his side 
I don't know if that's true, but I've been told 
It's real sweet to grow old

Look high, it's my last hope 
Chavo Guerrero coming off the top rope


Whipped like a dog, down on the cards 
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard 
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe 
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe

Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object 
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear 
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere 
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low 
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object 
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object 
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite 
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night 
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs 
If you can't beat 'em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object 
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object 
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object 
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object


"One, two. Two, three, and."

Eighteen-man steel cage free-for-all 
Through the noise I hear you call for help 
You can't protect yourself

Frog mask and yellow cape 
So desperate to escape 
I came to you, hands wrapped in adhesive tape

That was when we were young and green 
In the dawning hours of our team 
Some things you will remember 
Some things stay sweet forever

Seen you backstage once or twice 
Animal gimmick pops real nice 
Elbow sweep and tiger dance 
Little extra fighter's chance

Hold on, I cried, I'll be right there 
Pull your mask down through your hair 
They won't see you 
Not until you want them to

That was when we were green and young 
Battle cry rising from your tongue 
Some things you will remember 
Some things stay sweet forever


Diamonds in the firmament 
All reserves completely spent 
Someone set up the oxygen tent 
Everybody here's real proud to present 
Choked out

Two hundred dollar take-all purse 
Half-nelson to suplex reverse 
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse 
At one, for once, with the universe 
Choked out

Choked out, choked out, choked out

I stretch and strain with all my might 
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night 
Kick and claw and scratch and bite 
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight 
Choked out

No brakes down 
An endless dark incline 
Most of the boys 
Won't ever cross this line 
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine 
Everybody's got their limits 
Nobody's found mine

Crowd screaming like hounds in the heat of the chase 
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face 
I lift right off into space 
I can see the future, it's a real dark place

Choked out, choked out, choked out 
Choked out, choked out, choked out


Get stomped like a snake 
Lie down in the dirt 
Cling to my convictions 
Even when I get hurt 
Be an upstanding well-loved man about town 
In your child's mind that's how it goes down

But I tried 
The losing side 
I don't want to die in here 
I don't want to die in here

Drift down into the new dark light 
Without any reservations 
You found my breaking point 
Congratulations 
Spend too much of my life now trying to play fair 
Throw my better self overboard, shoot at him when he comes up for air

Come unhinged 
Get revenge 
I don't want to die in here 
I don't want to die in here

Stay good under pressure 
For years and years and years and years 
President of the fan club up there 
Choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down 
From way up in the rafters 
I'm walking out of here in one piece 
Don't care what comes after

Drive the wedge 
Torch the bridge 
I don't want to die in here 
I don't want to die in here


Two blinded in Detroit 
Something must be done 
Jaws dropping at ringside 
In the blood tide 
When the fireball hits

Down Indiana way 
Make 'em check their guns 
Real tears when it's over 
Smell the sulfur 
When the dark vault splits

Lord of the hidden pocket knife 
Tawdry dreams all come to life 
Save yourselves 
Save this town, save everything not nailed down

War in Ontario 
Dead before the bell 
Crushed hopes of the young breed 
All the best bleed 
All the proud boys break

Who will stand before the flood? 
Who will mop up all the blood? 
Who alone? 
Skin, bone, steel, stone 
Swim or drown 
Save this town, save everything not nailed down


The winter's wet, and the summer's hot 
Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not 
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber 
From the recesses of the earth, put on your waders 
And twitch when the water runs high sometimes 
Twitch when the tide ebbs low

See the sights, maybe go downtown 
Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around 
When the blade hits the bone, everybody hears it sing 
Shower room full of people, no one hears a goddamned thing 
And twitch when the current runs wild sometimes 
Twitch when the contact howls

All that racket out there in the arena 
I'm on a stretcher, here come the cleaners 
And the sky goes dark and there I am 
Climbing down the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram 
I drop from the top of my tall steel cage 
Drop to the concrete floor


I was not there for rehearsal, I don't need it any more 
When I show up just in time to pop you can clear the goddamn floor 
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space 
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face 
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms 
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot 
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I've got 
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can't sell 
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell 
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms 
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds 
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds 
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed 
Bring your heroes to the wolf den, watch them all get crushed 
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on 
Everyone still in this building right now: dead before the dawn 
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms 
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms


All gone, all gone 
Watching it go up out front on the lawn 
Stay on my feet somehow 
I'm strong now 
Stuck there, no air

Head high, head high 
Tongues of fire that reach up for the sky 
Rise through the smoke 
The dust of the grave 
I will be saved

Pause in mid-stride 
Pause in mid-stride 
And ride, and ride, and ride, and ride

Burn hard, burn hard 
Smoldering pieces landing in the yard 
Trace names in ash 
Big names, old friends 
And dead ends

Those last few frames 
Go down so fast 
Rise through the flames and end again in flames at last

Stay free, stay free 
Invisible armies march by night for me 
Stay on my guard 
Burn hard 
Rage on 
All gone

Pause in mid-stride 
Pause in mid-stride 
And ride, and ride, and ride, and ride

Rain beats down, down on the outer walls 
Down on the skylight, where the streetlights 
Shine like unquenchable coals 
And I'm up high, trying to say goodbye 
The only way I know how 
Crude and graceless 
Peeking through the eyeholes 
Seeing the real you

And just after midnight 
When it feels like it's getting late 
I will reveal you 
I will reveal you

Crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on 
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last 
You don't care, you look almost relieved down there 
Like you're free, like you can breathe now 
Like they've sawn off your cast 
One more sleeper to see through

And by way of honoring 
The things we once both held dear 
I will reveal you 
I will reveal you

Cast of thousands 
But we were the real two 
When I'm alone 
Before a mirror late at night 
I will reveal you 
I will reveal you


Drive a great big truck 
When I'm old, when I'm old 
Haul the wrecks down to the wreck yard 
Help the boys unload 
Keep my hair nice and long 
Because I can, because I can 
Any of my old friends who have no place to turn to 
They know to call me any time they come through

Never die, never die 
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand 
And rise, rise 
In the desert sand

Work days, work nights 
Finally get laid up 
By a piece of broken glass 
On the floor of the shop 
And the doctor recognizes me 
As the operating theater goes dim 
Aren't you that old wrestler with the bullwhip? 
Yes sir, that's me, I'm him

Get around fine on one leg 
Lose a kidney, then go blind 
Sit on my porch in Houston 
Let the good times dance across my mind

Never die, never die 
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand 
And rise, rise 
Surrounded by friends


You'll be maybe lunging for the bad guy's hip 
No one anticipates the sunset flip 
The referee and your opponent will hold you there 
And we're gonna bring in a folding chair

We'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming 
But of course there will be several in the building 
And if by chance somebody hits record 
And stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard

Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street 
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat 
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike 
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like

Some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay 
Some hide behind their programs, some turn away 
Out in the parking lot you look up at the stars 
And all the cheap cars
